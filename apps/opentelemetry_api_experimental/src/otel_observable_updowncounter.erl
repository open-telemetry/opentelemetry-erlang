%% @doc Asynchronous UpDownCounter is an asynchronous Instrument which
%% reports additive value(s) (e.g. the process heap size - it makes
%% sense to report the heap size from multiple processes and sum them up,
%% so we get the total heap usage) when the instrument is being observed.
%%
%% Note: if the value is monotonically increasing, use Asynchronous Counter
%% instead; if the value is non-additive, use Asynchronous Gauge instead.
