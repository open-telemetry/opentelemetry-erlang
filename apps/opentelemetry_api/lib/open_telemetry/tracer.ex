defmodule OpenTelemetry.Tracer do
  @moduledoc """
  This module contains macros for Tracer operations around the lifecycle of the Spans within a Trace.

  The Tracer is able to start a new Span as a child of the active Span of the current process, set
  a different Span to be the current Span by passing the Span's context, end a Span or run a code
  block within the context of a newly started span that is ended when the code block completes.

  The macros use the Tracer registered to the Application the module using the macro is included in,
  assuming `OpenTelemetry.register_application_tracer/1` has been called for the Application. If
  not then the default Tracer is used.

  Updates the Span name.

  It is highly discouraged to update the name of a Span after its creation. Span name is
  often used to group, filter and identify the logical groups of spans. And often, filtering
  logic will be implemented before the Span creation for performance reasons. Thus the name
  update may interfere with this logic.

  The function name is called UpdateName to differentiate this function from the regular
  property setter. It emphasizes that this operation signifies a major change for a Span
  and may lead to re-calculation of sampling or filtering decisions made previously
  depending on the implementation.
