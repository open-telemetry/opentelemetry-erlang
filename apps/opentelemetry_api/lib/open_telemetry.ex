defmodule OpenTelemetry do
  @moduledoc """
  An [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) Trace consists of 1 or more Spans that either have a
  parent/child relationship or are linked together through a Link. Each Span has a TraceId (`t:trace_id/0`),
  SpanId (`t:span_id/0`), and a start and end time in nanoseconds.

  This module provides declaration of the types used throughout the library, as well as functions for
  building the additional pieces of a span that are optional. Each item can be attached to individual
  Span using the functions in `OpenTelemetry.Span` module.

  ## Example

      require OpenTelemetry.Tracer, as: Tracer

      Tracer.with_span "some-span" do
        event = OpenTelemetry.event("ecto.query", query: query, total_time: total_time)
        Tracer.add_events([event])
      end

  Span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be
  nested to form a trace tree. Spans may also be linked to other spans
  from the same or different trace and form graphs. Often, a trace
  contains a root span that describes the end-to-end latency, and one
  or more subspans for its sub-operations. A trace can also contain
  multiple root spans, or none at all. Spans do not need to be
  contiguous - there may be gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.
