[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) distributed tracing framework for
Erlang and Elixir.

These applications implement version 1.8.0 of the [OpenTelemetry
Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification),
see the [spec compliance
matrix](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/spec-compliance-matrix.md)
for a list of features supported.

## Requirements

- Erlang/OTP 23+ (With best effort for OTP 22 support)

If using the Elixir API:

- Elixir 1.13+

## Contacting Us

We hold weekly meetings. See details at [community page](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#special-interest-groups).

We use [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang/discussions)
for support or general questions. Feel free to drop us a line.

We are also present in the #otel-erlang-elixir channel in the [CNCF
slack](https://slack.cncf.io/). Please join us for more informal discussions.

You can also find us in the #opentelemetry channel on [Elixir
Slack](https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting Started

You can find a getting started guide on [opentelemetry.io](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/erlang/getting-started/).

To start capturing distributed traces from your application it first needs to be
instrumented. The easiest way to do this is by using an instrumentation library.
There are a number of [officially supported instrumentation
libraries](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang-contrib) for
popular Erlang and Elixir libraries and frameworks.

## Design

The [OpenTelemetry
specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification)
defines a language library as having two components, the API and the SDK. The API
must not only define the interfaces of any implementation in that language but
also be able to function as a noop implementation of the tracer. The SDK is the
default implementation of the API that must be optional.

When instrumenting a project, your application should only depend on the
[OpenTelemetry API](https://hex.pm/packages/opentelemetry_api) application,
found in directory `apps/opentelemetry_api` of this repo. The API is published as
the Hex package [opentelemetry_api](https://hex.pm/packages/opentelemetry_api).

The SDK implementation, found under `apps/opentelemetry` and Hex package
[opentelemetry](https://hex.pm/packages/opentelemetry), should be included in an
OTP Release along with an exporter.

Example of Release configuration in `rebar.config`:

```erlang
{relx, [{release, {my_instrumented_release, "0.1.0"},
         [opentelemetry_exporter,
	      {opentelemetry, temporary},
          my_instrumented_app]},

       ...]}.
```

Example configuration for [mix's Release
task](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html):

```elixir
def project do
  [
    releases: [
      my_instrumented_release: [
        applications: [opentelemetry_exporter: :permanent, opentelemetry: :temporary]
      ],

      ...
    ]
  ]
end
```

Note that you also need to add `opentelemetry_exporter` before your other `opentelemetry` dependencies in `mix.exs`,
so that it starts before `opentelemetry` does.

In the above example `opentelemetry_exporter` is listed first, ensuring that all of its
dependencies are booted before `opentelemetry` attempts to start the
exporter. `opentelemetry` is set to `temporary` so that if the `opentelemetry`
application crashes, or is shutdown, it does not terminate the other
applications in the project -- `opentelemetry_exporter` does not need to be
`temporary` because it does not have a startup and supervision tree. This is
optional; the `opentelemetry` application purposely sticks to `permanent` for
the processes started by the root supervisor to leave it up to the end user
whether they want the crash or shutdown or `opentelemetry` to be ignored or
cause the shutdown of the rest of the applications in the release.

## Git Dependencies

While it is recommended to use the Hex packages for the
[API](https://hex.pm/packages/opentelemetry_api),
[SDK](https://hex.pm/packages/opentelemetry) and [OTLP
exporter](https://hex.pm/packages/opentelemetry_exporter), there are times
depending on the git repo is necessary. Because the OpenTelemetry OTP
Applications are kept in a single repository, under the directory `apps`, either
[rebar3's](https://rebar3.org) `git_subdir` (rebar 3.14 or above is required) or
[mix's](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)
`sparse` feature must be used when using these as Git dependencies in a project. The
blocks below show how the git repo for the API and/or SDK
Applications can be used in rebar3 and mix.

```erlang
{opentelemetry_api, {git_subdir, "http://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang", {branch, "main"}, "apps/opentelemetry_api"}},
{opentelemetry, {git_subdir, "http://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang", {branch, "main"}, "apps/opentelemetry"}},
{opentelemetry_exporter, {git_subdir, "http://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang", {branch, "main"}, "apps/opentelemetry_exporter"}}
```

```elixir
{:opentelemetry_api, github: "open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang", sparse:
"apps/opentelemetry_api", override: true},
{:opentelemetry, github: "open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang", sparse:
"apps/opentelemetry", override: true},
{:opentelemetry_exporter, github: "open-telemetry/opentelemetry-erlang", sparse: "apps/opentelemetry_exporter", override: true}
```

The `override: true` is required because the SDK Application, `opentelemetry`, has
the API in its `deps` list of its `rebar.config` as a Hex dependency and this will
clash when `mix` tries to resolve the dependencies and fail without the
override. `override: true` is also used on the SDK because the
`opentelemetry_exporter` application depends on it and the API as Hex deps so if
it is included the override is necessary.

## Benchmarks

Running benchmarks is done with [benchee](https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee). Benchmark functions are stored in modules, under `samples/`. To run them, open a rebar3 shell in the `bench` profile:

```shell
$ rebar3 as bench shell

> otel_benchmarks:run().
```

If an Elixir script is wanted for the benchmarks they could be run (after
running `rebar3 as bench compile`) as follows:

```shell
$ ERL_AFLAGS="-pa ./_build/bench/extras/samples/" ERL_LIBS=_build/bench/lib/ mix run --no-mix-exs samples/run.exs
```

## W3C Trace Context Interop Tests

Start the interop web server in a shell:

```shell
$ rebar3 as interop shell

> w3c_trace_context_interop:start().
```

Then, clone the [W3C Trace Context repo](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context) and run the tests:

```shell
$ cd test
$ python3 test.py http://127.0.0.1:5000/test
```
